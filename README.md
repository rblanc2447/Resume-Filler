# Resume-Filler
The resume filler plugin is a versatile browser extension designed to simplify the resume creation process. Compatible with popular browsers, it streamlines the task of populating resume templates by automatically extracting and organizing relevant information from various online sources. 

The resume filler plugin saves time and ensures accuracy, enabling users to create polished resumes that highlight their skills and experiences with ease.

Using Python, I developed the backend functionality of the plugin. This involved implementing web scraping techniques to extract data from online sources such as LinkedIn and GitHub. I utilized libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests in Python to scrape and parse the required information efficiently.

On the frontend, JavaScript was employed to create an interactive and responsive user interface. JavaScript allowed me to handle user actions, retrieve data from the backend, and dynamically update the resume template in real-time. I utilized frameworks like React or jQuery to enhance the plugin's functionality and provide a smooth user experience.

By combining the strengths of Python and JavaScript, I was able to create a robust and efficient resume filler plugin that simplifies the resume creation process for users, making it easier for them to generate professional resumes with accurate information.




STEPS TO ADD Plugin to Browser

1. Open the browser's extension settings: Launch the browser in which you want to add the plugin and navigate to the extension settings page. The location of this page may vary depending on the browser you are using. Look for an option like "Extensions," "Add-ons," or "Plugins" in the browser's menu or settings.

2. Enable developer mode: Enable the developer or advanced mode in the browser's extension settings. This mode allows you to manually load and add custom plugins.

3. Load the plugin: Look for an option to "Load unpacked" or "Load extension" in the extension settings page. Click on this option to open a file dialog.

4. Select the JSON file: In the file dialog, navigate to the directory where your JSON file is located and select it. This will load the plugin from the JSON file into the browser.

4. Confirm the addition: After selecting the JSON file, the browser should confirm that the plugin has been successfully added. You may need to grant any necessary permissions for the plugin to function correctly.

5. Test the plugin: Once added, test the plugin by accessing its features or functionality. Ensure that it operates as intended and that there are no errors or conflicts with other extensions.

By following these steps, you should be able to add your plugin as a JSON file to the browser of your choice. Remember to consult the specific documentation and guidelines for the target browser to ensure compatibility and adherence to any additional requirements.
